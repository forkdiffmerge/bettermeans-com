# Open, Democratic Project Management

## Decide together.  
Get things done.  
No bosses needed.

### Use open-source decision-making rules,  
and self-organizing principles  
to run your real-world projects.

## We need a new agreement of how we work together.

How we make decisions. How we decide on who gets to work on what. And who gets paid what.

Groups of people can work together intelligently, without getting bogged down in endless meetings, or slow decision making. No bossing needed.

**Open source software and Wikipedia**, are just two examples of large groups working together efficiently without fixed hierarchy.

Bettermeans lets you **use the same decision-making rules, and self-organizing principles behind open source** to run your project.
